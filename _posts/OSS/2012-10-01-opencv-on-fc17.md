Installation of required packages by root (first line is essential for everything, others depend on whether you want the video and GUI interfaces respectively): 

{% highlight bash %}
yum install cmake gcc-c++ 
yum install ffmpeg ffmpeg-devel
yum install gtk2-devel

{% endhighlight %}

Download the latest code :

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git://code.opencv.org/opencv.git

{% endhighlight %}

Build the code in an out-of-source directory (chosen to be 'release' here) :

{% highlight bash %}
cd opencv
mkdir release
cd release
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
make

{% endhighlight %}

Finally, to install (not really required) : 

{% highlight bash %}
make install 

{% endhighlight %}

The last step isn't essential if you are developing your own code, since the most natural way of doing this is to create a cmake build of your own source tree, and that can be encouraged to link directly into the 'release' code built above.

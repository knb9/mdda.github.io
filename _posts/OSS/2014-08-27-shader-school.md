Wanting to get acquainted with writing shaders, and 
having recently run through the NodeSchool units in preparation 
for [the first Singapore NodeSchool](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/174971982/) 
(organised by Tim Oxley through 
the [Singapore Javascript MeetUp Group, aka 'Talk.js'](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/)),
I had a play with the excellent [shader-school package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shader-school).

My enthusiasm lead me to present to 
the [Singapore GPU Users MeetUp Group](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-GPU-Users/) which 
is organized by Gabriel Noaje (with the always-present assistance of Nvidia...)


### Presentation Link

I recently gave a <strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2014-08-27_shader-school/" target="_blank">presentation about this project</a></strong> 
to the [Singapore GPU Users MeetUp Group](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-GPU-Users/events/197909292/).

This post is likely to talk about radeon and AMD drivers...

  * Notebook upgrade = Fine (after some fiddling around with ```kmod-wl```)
  * Desktop machine 'epoch' = Fine (almost zero issues)
  
  * Desktop machine 'square' = Non-responsive ```Failed to get to systemd.initialized```
  
Comment out (for now) in ```/etc/modprobe.d/fglrx.conf``` :

{% highlight bash %}
blacklist radeon
{% endhighlight %}

This allows (for instance) ```3.17.4-301.fc21``` to boot, 
but Plymouth not Quitting (```radeon``` is loaded).  Therefore, chief 
suspect is the AMD graphics drivers.

### Building ```fglrx``` on ```3.17.6-300```

Make sure that ```kernel-devel``` and ```kernel-headers``` available for the latest
kernel available in the machine. 



{% highlight bash %}
cd fglrx-install.xxxxxx/
cd install/lib/modules/fglrx/build_mod
./make.sh
{% endhighlight %}

This last command will probably fail with an error similar to this : 

{% highlight bash %}
/<path>/fglrx-14.501.1003/fglrx-install.2Kq7qH/install/lib/modules/fglrx/build_mod/2.6.x/kcl_acpi.c: In function ‘KCL_ACPI_Slot_No_Hotplug’:
/<path>/fglrx-14.501.1003/fglrx-install.2Kq7qH/install/lib/modules/fglrx/build_mod/2.6.x/kcl_acpi.c:845:21: error: ‘struct acpi_device_flags’ has no member named ‘no_hotplug’
          tdev->flags.no_hotplug = true;
                     ^
{% endhighlight %}

The simplest (kludgiest) way to eliminate this error is to remove the reference to ```flags.no_hotplug```, by commenting it out (cringy, I know).  So, simply :

{% highlight bash %}
joe 2.6.x/kcl_acpi.c  
#(goto line ~845)
// no_hotplug // comment out line
{% endhighlight %}

Then redo the ```make.sh``` and (if eveything goes through without complaint) carry on :

{% highlight bash %}
#after fixing up 2.6.x/kcl_acpi.c
./make.sh
cd ..
./make_install.sh
{% endhighlight %}

At this point, there should be no problem going back to the 'GUI' screen and running the installation from there - the source has been fixed up sufficiently.  This will also re-do the blacklist thing, and (IIRC) set up the code to regenerate the module when the kernel is (minorly) upgraded.

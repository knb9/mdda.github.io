This post is likely to talk about radeon and AMD drivers...

  * Notebook upgrade = Fine (after some fiddling around with ```kmod-wl```)
  * Desktop machine 'epoch' = Fine (almost zero issues)
  
  * Desktop machine 'square' = Non-responsive ```Failed to get to systemd.initialized```
  
Comment out (for now) in ```/etc/modprobe.d/fglrx.conf``` :
```
blacklist radeon
```

This allows (for instance) ```3.17.4-301.fc21``` to boot, 
but Plymouth not Quitting (```radeon``` is loaded).  Therefore, chief 
suspect is the AMD graphics drivers.

### Building ```fglrx``` on ```3.17.6-300```

Make sure that ```kernel-devel``` and ```kernel-headers``` available for the latest
kernel available in the machine. 

Really wants to be on 3.17.6-300 ... to build fglrx package
on : 3.17.6-300 :::

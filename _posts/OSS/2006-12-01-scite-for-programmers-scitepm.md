[ScitePM](http://sourceforge.net/projects/scitepm/) is a lightweight, Gtk-based project manager for use with the SciTE editor.     
  
ScitePM allows the user to organize a set of files as a project, like most IDEs, and then open them within SciTE.  
  
The User interface now defaults to being a  'skinny' column of files / project items on the LHS of the screen, so that the SCiTE editor can maximized over the rest of the screen.

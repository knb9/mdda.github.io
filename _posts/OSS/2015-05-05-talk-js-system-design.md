Since January 2015, I've been working with a local Singapore company on a 
Natural Language Processing task to help them (a) tackle new markets more quickly and efficiently;
and (b) offer the system as a product to other companies that need to 
extract Entities and Relationships from Unstructured Data (e.g.: PDFs of legal filings)
- particularly when the need for accuracy is paramount.  

### Presentation Link

I recently gave a <strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2015-05-07_PuttingTogether.prj/" target="_blank">presentation about this project</a></strong> 
to the  [talk.js Singapore Javascript Group](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/222087414/).

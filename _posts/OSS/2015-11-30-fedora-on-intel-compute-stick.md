I recently won an Intel Compute Stick (Windows version) at the [Singapore FinTech 'Compliance' Hackathon](http://e27.co/event/fintechathon/)
(aka the Fintechathon).  The Windows version has 2Gb of RAM, and 32Gb of ~SSD 
(compared that to the version with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit installed, which only comes with 1Gb and 8Gb respectively - go figure).

Of course, booting into Windows was not an option.  
However, my distribution preference is Fedora (rather than Ubuntu, 
which obviously has received more attention from Intel, since it's the officially supported version).

Installing Fedora on the device turned into (yet another) weekend of frustration and small gains...

{% include JB/setup %}

The uploader behaviour for ```Dropzone``` changed from previous versions, 
making the existing links to sample code outdated.  

I found this out after updating to a new version of a site template that
I was using - finding that my previous working code stopped working.

The following currently works : Dropzone vX.Y.Z, Express vA.B.C

### In the GUI

{% highlight html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
{% endhighlight %}

### On the Express server 

{% highlight javascript %}
{% endhighlight %}

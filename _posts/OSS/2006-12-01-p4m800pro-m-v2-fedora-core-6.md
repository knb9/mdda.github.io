Bought from  [WWW.PC-RACK.COM](http://www.pc-rack.com/)   via e-bay.  Sweet deal.  Well put together machine (80Gb PATA HD, 512Mb of DDR2 DRAM).  
  
Problem areas :  


  * Read that choice of Apperture size (64Mb) is important.
  * Getting correct screen resolution (using only LCD display for set-up).
  
Disappearing network interface:  


  * Software Shutdown has no effect.
  * Front panel power-off (held down until power-down) has no effect.
  * Power cord removal (and power-supply power-down) for 5 seconds restores network card visibility.
  * BIOS 061004 update didnÂ´t have any effect.

Wanting to get acquainted with the Go language, I found a Kaggle competition
(the [Reverse Game-of-Life](http://www.kaggle.com/c/conway-s-reverse-game-of-life)) 
that seemed approachable, and launched into it.

The presentation was a rerun of my [previous talk](/oss/2014/06/05/reverse-gol/) - 
because two Singapore GoLang meet-ups joined forces.  Fortunately, 
I wasn't heckled too badly by the half of the audience who had already heard it.

### Presentation Link

I recently gave a <strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2014-10-14_Reverse-GoL/" target="_blank">presentation about this project</a></strong> 
to the combined GoSG Groups [the Facebook-oriented Singapore Gophers](https://www.facebook.com/events/322218307949631/)
and [the original GoSG MeetUp Group](http://www.meetup.com/golangsg/events/212375352/).

Wanting to get acquainted with the Go language, I found a Kaggle competition
(the [Reverse Game-of-Life](http://www.kaggle.com/c/conway-s-reverse-game-of-life)) 
that seemed approachable, and launched into it.

The presentation was at the first of the Singapore GoLang meet-up,
and was (I have to say) a bit of a mish-mash.  I gave the same basic
content, in a much 'tighter' form in [October 2014]().

### Presentation Link

I recently gave a <strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com//" target="_blank">presentation about this project</a></strong> 
to the [GoSG MeetUp Group](http://www.meetup.com/golangsg/events/185174372/).

If there are any questions about the presentation, please ask below, or via the MeetUp group.

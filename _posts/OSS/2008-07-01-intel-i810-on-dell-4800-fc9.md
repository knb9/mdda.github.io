The `intel` driver seems to have gone a few optimizations too far - so that it hangs the machine in its default state.  Here's what works for me (start with `Option "NoAccel" "true"`, and work your way up as far as possible without crashing):  
  

{% highlight bash %}
# From /etc/X11/xorg.conf  
  
  
Section "Device"  
Identifier "Videocard0"  
Driver "intel"  
# Option "NoAccel" "true"  
  
Option "FramebufferCompression" "true"  
Option "Tiling" "true"  
Option "DRI" "true"  
  
Option "Legacy3D" "true"  
Option "XVideo" "false"  
Option "AperTexSize" "8"  
  
Option "AccelMethod" "XAA"  
#Option "AccelMethod" "EXA"  
  
Option "ModeDebug" "true"  
  
BusID "PCI:0:2:0"  
EndSection  

{% endhighlight %}
All of these options (with terse descriptions) can be found on the `man intel` pages.

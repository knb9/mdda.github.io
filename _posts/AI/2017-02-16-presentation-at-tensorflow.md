### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I recently started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp,
and [the first MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/237032130/) 
was hosted by Google themselves, in their spacious new Singapore offices.

We decided that, in addition to a round up of TensorFlow Summit news (the Summit had taken place
on the 15-Feb-2017 in SF), we'd have one Intro talk and one that was slightly more involved.  Since I 
already had something ready-to-go, I updated my 'ecommerce' CNN example from the deep-learning-workshop (see below)
to work with TensorFlow, and presented that for about ~30 mins including questions. 

Since this is a continuation of my previous workshops, all the source is available 
on <a href="https://github.com/mdda/deep-learning-workshop" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - 
if you have questions on the software, please leave an 'issue' there.

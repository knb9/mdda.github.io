Sam Witteveen and I recently started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp,
and [the second MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/237860964/) 
was hosted by Google themselves, in their spacious Singapore offices.

We were also lucky to be able to give Andrews Selle (from Google Brain in Mountainview) a speaker slot,
and he talked about the new TensorFlow XLA infrastructure (included a walk-though of 
exactly how a new TensorFlow model could be rebuilt into a pure C/C++ library file for a mobile device).

Since Sam wanted to talk about GANs (in what now seems to be a prelude to next month's MeetUp, which
could well have a GAN theme), it fell to me to do the Intro talk - and the topic was CNNs.  The basic 
outline of the talk followed my (longer) FOSSASIA workshop from a couple of days before.  There 
are links given in the presentation to the code and online examples.

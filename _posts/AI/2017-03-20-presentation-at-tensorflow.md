Sam Witteveen and I recently started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp,
and [the second MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/237860964/) 
was hosted by Google themselves, in their spacious Singapore offices.

We were also lucky to be able to give Andrews Selle (from Google Brain in Mountainview) a speaker slot,
during which he talked about the new TensorFlow XLA infrastructure (included a walk-though of 
exactly how a new TensorFlow model could be rebuilt into a pure C/C++ library file for a mobile device.


 we'd have one Intro talk and one that was slightly more involved.  Since I 
already had something ready-to-go, I updated my 'ecommerce' CNN example from the deep-learning-workshop (see below)
to work with TensorFlow, and presented that for about ~30 mins including questions. 

Since this is a continuation of my previous workshops, all the source is available 
on <a href="https://github.com/mdda/deep-learning-workshop" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - 
if you have questions on the software, please leave an 'issue' there.

The presentation was kindly <a href="https://engineers.sg/v/1436" target="_blank">recorded by Engineers.sg</a> and then
paintaking re-edited together due to some AV weirdness...

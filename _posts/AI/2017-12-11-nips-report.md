#### 202 : [NIPS HIGHLIGHTS, LEARN HOW TO CODE A PAPER WITH STATE OF THE ART FRAMEWORKS](https://mltrain.cc/events/nips-highlights-learn-how-to-code-a-paper-with-state-of-the-art-frameworks/)  

*  09:45 - 10:05 : Tips and tricks of coding papers on PyTorch - Sumith Chintalla, Facebook
   *  Start with experiments for basic outline
   *  Choose the simplest (non-MNIST) dataset to start with

   *  Hyperparameters are often hidden
   *  Profile code (eg: lineprofiler)
   
*  10:05 - 10:25 : Differentiable Learning of Logical Rules for Knowledge Base Reasoning - Fan Yang, CMU
   *  TensorFlow (sparse matrices too)
   *  Code is online : github.com/fanyangxyz/Neural-LP
   *  batch_size is a problem, since whole KB also nees to be in memory
   

**10:15 - 11:00 : Morning Posters**

*  10:45 - 11:15 : Coding Reinforcement Learning Papers by Shangtong Zhang , University of Alberta
   *  Better to implement from scratch : Improve own understanding
   *  Start without all the tricks (bells &amp; whistles)
   *  Patience : 
      *  A3C + Atari = 1hr
      *  DQN + Atari = 1 day 
      *  Async Q/SARSA + Atari = n days
   *  No random seed...
   *  Has now moved off TF to PyTorch, but still likes TensorBoard
   *  np.argmax(values + rand()) to avoid consistent choice of argmax index
   *  For Linear value-function approximation : Suggest Tile coding : ```tile3```
   *  Share CNN lower layers for separate Actor-Critic output final layers
   *  Roboschool is Free version of MoJoCo
   *  Actor/Critic - even simple networks work v well

*  11:15 - 11:35 : A Linear-Time Kernel Goodness-of-Fit Test (NIPS 2017 Best paper) - Wittawat Jitkrittum, GATSBY
   *  Simple procedure to find worst-fit location between given density and data

*  11:35 - 11:55 : Imagination-Augmented Agents for Deep Reinforcement Learning - Sébastien Racaniere, DeepMind
   *  Sonnet code - completely compatible with TensorFlow
   *  Extensive explanation of all the different components of the imagination structure

*  11:55 - 12:15 : Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs - Will Hamilton, Stanford
   *  github.com/williamleif/GraphSAGE
   *  Able to generate embeddings/feature representations as graph changes dynamically
   *  Aggregate operator : Permutation invariant NN  (could be DeepSets)
   *  Large wins over pure features, or Node2Vec
   *  Collaboration with Pinterest - better accuracy, etc on 3bn node and 12bn edges
   *  Problem : batching on GPU...
      *  Sample fixed-sized neighbourhoods (say, size 3) randomly with replacement
      *  Good scaling performance (no need to do lots of samples, eg gains max out quickly) 
      *  Depth of 2 or 3 works fine (no need to have larger depth in hops)
      *  Represent node-node lists densely, choosing at random, rather than sparsely
      *  Do ~tf.shuffle, and ~tf.slice to sample nodes rather than numpy

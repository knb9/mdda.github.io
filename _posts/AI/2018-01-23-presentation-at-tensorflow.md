### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the tenth MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning: 2018 What's new and what's changed](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/246745197/),
was again hosted by Google.

The line-up of talks included my talk on WaveNet, a guest speaker talking about Federated Learning, 
a lightning talk about eye tracking, and Sam describing GANs and his experience with the TFGAN framework.

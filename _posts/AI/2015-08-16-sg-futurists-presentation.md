### Presentation Link

I recently gave a <strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2015-06-19_Presentation-PyConSG/" target="_blank">presentation about Python, Theano, Blocks and Deep Learning</a></strong> 
at the [2015 Singapore PyCon](https://pycon.sg/).

If there are any questions about the presentation, please ask below - 
alternatively, have a look at my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mdda/pycon.sg-2015_deep-learning) 
that contains all the iPython notebooks, code and documentation that I put together
in preparation for the talk.

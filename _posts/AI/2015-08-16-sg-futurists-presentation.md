### Presentation Outline

#### MeetUp Promises
Martin will provide 

  an overview of concepts and themes in Artificial Intelligence, 
    including a review of the field today (notably deep learning) 
    
  his perspective on Artificial General Intelligence.


#### Ideas

Basic philosophical ideas - 

  - Not the meat of the talk...

The past
  Chess
  Jeopardy
  Driverless cars

Current cycle focussing on Deep Learning
  - GPU : Turning point
  - Data : More important than realised

What can be done now
  - audio : In Android 
  - vision : ImageNet
  - translation :
  - labelling of images :
  
  - reinforcement learning :

How far can Deep Learning take us?

How about Real AI?

I recently gave a <strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2015-06-19_Presentation-PyConSG/" target="_blank">presentation about Python, Theano, Blocks and Deep Learning</a></strong> 
at the [2015 Singapore PyCon](https://pycon.sg/).

If there are any questions about the presentation, please ask below - 
alternatively, have a look at my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mdda/pycon.sg-2015_deep-learning) 
that contains all the iPython notebooks, code and documentation that I put together
in preparation for the talk.

### Presentation Outline

#### MeetUp Promises

The talk will provide :

*  an overview of concepts and themes in Artificial Intelligence, 
     + including a review of the field today (notably deep learning) 
    
*  his perspective on Artificial General Intelligence.


#### Ideas

The past:
*  Chess
*  Jeopardy
*  Driverless cars

The past (individual slides):
*  Chess

*  Jeopardy

*  Driverless cars


Current cycle focussing on Deep Learning :
*  GPU : Turning point
*  Data : More important than realised
*  New thinking 
*  Better-than-expected

Each in turn (individual slides) :
*  GPU : Turning point

*  Data : More important than realised

*  New thinking : 
     +    Sigmoids out, ReLUs in
     +    Dropout
     +    Batch normalization
     +    Networks for the whole stack
     
*  Better-than-expected
     +    Convolutional networks for images
     +    Word Embedding
     +    Transfer learning 


What can be done now:
*  audio : In Android 
*  vision : ImageNet, google house numbers
*  translation : google translate (yes, compressed)
*  labelling of images : 
*  reinforcement learning : 

Each in turn (individual slides) :
*  audio : In Android 

*  vision : ImageNet, google house numbers

*  translation : google translate (yes, compressed)

*  labelling of images : 

*  reinforcement learning : 


How far can Deep Learning take us?
*   lots of fruit now found to be 'hanging low'
*   building ladder to the moon


Each in turn (individual slides) :
*   lots of fruit now found to be 'hanging low'

*   building ladder to the moon


Basic philosophical ideas --  Not the meat of the talk...
*   Convert one neuron at a time
*   Chinese Room
*   Turing Test

Each in turn (individual slides) :
*   Convert one neuron at a time
    -   In-principle idea

*   Chinese Room
    -   System (vs operator) intelligence 

*   Turing Test
    -   Cheating is now the issue
    

How about Real AI?

*   Substrate for brain may be poor for 'higher order thinking'
*   'Thought process' of AI may be very different (compare pre- and post- internet search strategies)
  
*   Conscious thought is the water's surface, whereas mind is the ocean

*   Deep Learning frontier is being pushed by competitions
    +   Need to figure out competitive 'thinking' data/interactions (rather than 1 per researcher)

I recently gave a <strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2015-06-19_Presentation-PyConSG/" target="_blank">presentation about Python, Theano, Blocks and Deep Learning</a></strong> 
at the [2015 Singapore PyCon](https://pycon.sg/).

If there are any questions about the presentation, please ask below - 
alternatively, have a look at my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mdda/pycon.sg-2015_deep-learning) 
that contains all the iPython notebooks, code and documentation that I put together
in preparation for the talk.

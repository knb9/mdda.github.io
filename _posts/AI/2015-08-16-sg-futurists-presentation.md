### Presentation Outline

#### MeetUp Promises

The talk will provide :

*  an overview of concepts and themes in Artificial Intelligence, 
     + including a review of the field today (notably deep learning) 
    
*  his perspective on Artificial General Intelligence.


#### Ideas

Front Page

About Me

The past:

*  Chess
*  Jeopardy
*  Driverless cars
   
   
The past (individual slides):

*  Chess

*  Jeopardy

*  Driverless cars


Current cycle focussing on Deep Learning :

*  GPU : Turning point
*  Data : More important than realised
*  New thinking 
*  Better-than-expected

Each in turn (individual slides) :

*  GPU : Turning point

*  Data : More important than realised

*  New thinking : 
     +    Sigmoids out, ReLUs in
     +    Dropout
     +    Batch normalization
     +    Networks for the whole stack
     
*  Better-than-expected
     +    Convolutional networks for images
     +    Word Embedding
     +    Transfer learning 



"AI Effect"

*  "AI Effect" : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect
   -   AI is whatever hasn't been done yet



What can be done now:

*  audio to text
*  vision - recognising 
*  language translation 
*  image captioning
*  reinforcement learning


Each in turn (individual slides) :

*  audio 
   +   In Android Jellybean (=4.3)
       -   http://www.phonearena.com/news/The-secret-of-Googles-amazing-voice-recognition-revealed-it-works-like-a-brain_id39938
   +   Voice search works in offline mode in Android Lolipop (=5.0)
       -   http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/100492/offline-voice-recognition-not-working 
   
   +   Also

       -   http://googleresearch.blogspot.sg/2015/08/the-neural-networks-behind-google-voice.html


*  vision 
   +   ImageNet
       -  Human-competitive (partly to do with dataset)
       
   +   google house numbers
       -  Better-than human :: http://www.geek.com/news/googles-neutral-networks-are-now-better-than-humans-at-reading-addresses-1581653/
       -  http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6082


*  translation 
   +   google translate 
       -   compressed blog posting confirms availability :: http://googleresearch.blogspot.sg/2015/07/how-google-translate-squeezes-deep.html
       -   has nice image
       


*  labelling of images 
   +   Quantity of image data
   +   Karpathy
   +   Google Photos (now)


*  reinforcement learning 
   +   DeepMind Atari


How far can Deep Learning take us?

*   lots of fruit now found to be 'hanging low'
*   building ladder to the moon


Each in turn (individual slides) :

*   lots of fruit now found to be 'hanging low'

    -   personal experience : Grammar as a Language => DeepNER

*   building ladder to the moon



Basic philosophical ideas --  Not the meat of the talk...

*   Convert one neuron at a time
*   Chinese Room
*   Turing Test

Each in turn (individual slides) :

*   Convert one neuron at a time
    -   In-principle idea

*   Chinese Room
    -   System (vs operator) intelligence 

*   Turing Test
    -   Cheating is now the issue
    

How about Real AI?

*   Substrate for brain may be poor for 'higher order thinking'
*   'Thought process' of AI may be very different (compare pre- and post- internet search strategies)
  
*   Conscious thought is the water's surface, whereas mind is the ocean

*   Deep Learning frontier is being pushed by competitions
    +   Need to figure out competitive 'thinking' data/interactions (rather than 1 per researcher)

### Presentation Link

I recently gave a <strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2015-06-19_Presentation-PyConSG/" target="_blank">presentation about Python, Theano, Blocks and Deep Learning</a></strong> 
at the [2015 Singapore PyCon](https://pycon.sg/).

If there are any questions about the presentation, please ask below - 
alternatively, have a look at my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mdda/pycon.sg-2015_deep-learning) 
that contains all the iPython notebooks, code and documentation that I put together
in preparation for the talk.

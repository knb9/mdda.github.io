As part of the [first Singapore NodeSchool](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/174971982/) 
(organised by Tim Oxley through 
the [Singapore Javascript MeetUp Group, aka 'Talk.js'](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/)),
I had the opportunity to give a quick 'lightning talk'
about [d3.js](http://d3js.org/), and its application for visualizing the dependency structure of parsed sentences.

### Presentation Link

I recently gave a <strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2014-08-27_shader-school/" target="_blank">presentation about this project</a></strong> 
at the [first Singapore NodeSchool](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/174971982/) .

If there are any questions about the presentation, please ask below, or via the MeetUp group (or at
the next NodeSchool!).

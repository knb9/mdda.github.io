[Do Deep Nets Really Need to be Deep?](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6184.pdf)


Intuition is tempting : 
  1000->1 reduction (talked about, though not demonstrated)
  deep networks better for learning than shallow
  what is advantage here of the shallow network?

What is point of H * K factorization?  

Problem with training on test data : Not really valid (test data is still 'valid input')

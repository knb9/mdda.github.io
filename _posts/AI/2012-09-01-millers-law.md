Miller's Law:
  "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information"

The exact numbers and types of conceptual chunks are not as important as the point that 
evolution has made some trade-offs when it comes to what the brain is built to handle.


Too few chunks as a limit, and a person's ability to juggle multiple simultaneous 
ongoing situations would be impaired : There are obvious ways in which this could be harmful for survival.

Too many chunks as a limit, assuming that access speeds and detail are not impaired, 
then more brain space must be given over to keeping the various chunks active.  


Overcoming limitations
---------------------------

In everyday life, people have strategies to overcome these limitations : For instance they might write 
information down, completely side-stepping having to keep all the information 'current' (or 'top of mind').


Why have limitations ?
---------------------------

Suppose that general AI was attainable,  
and the mechanism for the retention of a single idea at the 'top of mind' was understood
(i.e. the implementation of the brain was done in a way that exposed some of the key 'modules' - 
rather than being an all-or-none black box).
Then the capabilities of the brain could be extended simply by expanding 
the 'top-of-mind' capacity to (say) 20 items.

It would be difficult not to grant that the AI was now superior in some respects to a regular human brain.
Maybe this superiority would not give it advantages in 'human' situations 
(but humans may have already self-selected the situations in which we find ourselves to avoid 'getting in too deep').
The machine would simply be able to juggle more mental balls simultaneously.  

So : Here's an example of how a superior intelligence might be created, once the basic AI model was completed.  
Not too threatening, but undeniably better.

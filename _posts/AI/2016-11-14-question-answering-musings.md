## Musings : Question Answering

An interesting (v. recent) paper from Google 
[Neural Symbolic Machines: Learning Semantic Parsers on Freebase with Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00020)...

The idea is to build a question&rarr;program translator that responds with 
the text of a program (which executes over the triples in Freebase).  

I figure that (compared to, say, translation) this is something that 
doesn't require data that only Google-sized people can get their hands on.  

And I figure that some Genetic Programming could feature in there too...


### Freebase Data

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase :
*   [Freebase Data Dumps - DEPRECATED](https://developers.google.com/freebase/)
*   Total triples: 1.9 billion
*   Data Format: N-Triples RDF
*   License: CC-BY
*   Size : 
    *   22 GB gzip
    *   250 GB uncompressed


### Simple Questions Dataset

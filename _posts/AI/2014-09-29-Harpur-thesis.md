This write-up contains a few takeaways that I had from the thesis :
[Low Entropy Coding with Unsupervised Neural Networks - (Harpur 1997)](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/reports/svr-ftp/auto-pdf/harpur_thesis.pdf).

### 3.2.5 Do PCA neural networks have a role?

> While interesting from a biological perspective, neural PCA models in their simplest form have little practical use since they will almost always be outperformed by the method of singular value decomposition.

But it should be pointed out that showing that biological networks can be made to perform PCA using only local interactions validates the idea that using SVD in a more typical computer setting should not be dismissed as being biologically implausible.

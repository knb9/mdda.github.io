This write-up contains my first impressions of the paper :
[Learning word embeddings efficiently with noise-contrastive estimation - (Mhih 2013)](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amnih/papers/wordreps.pdf)

Thinned out words, by rejecting any with <10 occurrences

### Interesting

Multiple representations for words


> Previous models                <br/>

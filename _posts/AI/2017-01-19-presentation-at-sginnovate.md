[SGInnovate](https://sginnovate.com/) is a new initiative (structured as a private company with a single government shareholder) 
that was launched in ~Nov-2016 with the ambition of making Singapore a hub for AI (and other high tech) businesses : 

>   We believe Singapore has the resources and capabilities to 'tackle hard problems' that matter to people around the world. 
>   SGInnovate has been established to help ambitious and capable people to build 'deep-tech' products borne out of science research.
>   
>   Our commitment is to use the full power of the Singapore ecosystem to achieve this mission.

They've been holding a series of their own social/tech events, as well as opening up their beautiful space at 
32 Carpenter Street to other tech MeetUps on an experimental basis, to 'see what happens'.  They invited me 
to talk at their recent AI/NLP focussed event.

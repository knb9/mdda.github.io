I recently lead a <strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2016-03-19_FOSSASIA-Workshop/" target="_blank">2 hour workshop</a></strong> 
at [FOSSASIA 2016](http://2016.fossasia.org/) in Singapore.

This workshop was hands-on : After a brief background on deep learning, 
participants started quickly, interacting with <a href="http://convnetjs.com/" target="_blank">ConvNet.js models</a>.  But 
this on-line portion was partly to allow everyone enough time to get the ~1Gb VirtualBox "appliance" created for the event 
installed on their laptops.  Fortunately, over 90% of the people who came, already had VirtualBox installed, which 
was a huge relief.

Once everyone was up-to-speed tools-wise, the workshop then progressed through a series of 
```Jupyter``` (fka ```iPython```) notebooks, ranging from Theano basics, through MNIST, to ImageNet networks 
(pretrained models of both ```GoogLeNet``` and ```Inception-v3``` were included in the VM).

Then, for the last half-hour, we went over two interesting applications : One with a
'commercial' angle (transfer learning), the other 'art' (using style-transfer).

Naturally, this being a FOSS event, all the source is available 
on <a href="https://github.com/mdda/fossasia-2016_deep-learning" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - 
if you have questions on the software, please leave an 'issue' there.

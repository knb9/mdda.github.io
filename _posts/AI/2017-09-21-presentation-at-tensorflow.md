Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the eighth MeetUp, aka TensorFlow.NEW](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/243269163/),
was again hosted by Google.

The feature speaker for the evening was Frank Chen, a Singaporean now working at Google Brain in Mountain View, California.
Frank's history includes studying at Stanford (after NS in Singapore), 
and being recruited as one of the first engineers at Coursera (during his undergrad).  He 
moved to Google earlier in 2017, and now works with TPUs as his day-job.  Awesome...

For my part, I gave a short 'practically oriented / brutally honest' presentation on installing TensorFlow from source.  
And then finished off with 3 quick 'lightning talks' - just to show how easy it is 
to stand up on stage and say something that people will find interesting.  Key takeaway : More people
should do the lightning talk thing.

### Video Link

No video from the night exists, because Frank's talk previewed a lot of the frontiers of where TensorFlow
is going, and (clearly) Google doesn't want to a pre-pre-alpha slidedeck becoming the _de facto_ documentation...

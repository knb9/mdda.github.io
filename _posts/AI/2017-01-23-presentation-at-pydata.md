### Presentation Link

Since I hadn't yet covered NLP and RNNs in Singapore, I gave a 
"<strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2017-01-23_PyDataSG_RNNs-for-NLP/" target="_blank">90 minute workshop</a></strong>" at the 
January meeting of the [Singapore PyData group](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-SG/events/235981761/).

Because it was a 'workshop', the Meetup had the following reminder :

>   Just as a quick reminder in preparation for Monday night's talk : If you want to get the most out of the 'middle 30 minutes' of the talk, please bring a laptop with VirtualBox already installed on it. USB keys with
>   a complete VirtualBox Appliance will be passed round, so that a whole sandboxed working environment can be brought up on your own machine instantly - which includes the RNN-for-NLP example using that we'll be walking through in detail.

Since this is a continuation of my previous workshops, all the source is available 
on <a href="https://github.com/mdda/deep-learning-workshop" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - 
if you have questions on the software, please leave an 'issue' there.

In addition to the Deep Learning Workshop I was planning to give at 
the [Fifth Elephant DataScience conference](https://fifthelephant.in/2016/) in Bangalore, India 
(which was attended by more that 1200 developers and data scientists),
I was asked to present on a more 'practical' topic : I suggested 'Lessons Learned : Real-life NLP'.

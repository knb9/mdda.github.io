Sam Witteveen and I recently started the PyTorch and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp,
and [the first MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/PyTorch-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/240312311/) 
was hosted at Facebook, in their new Singapore offices.

By design, this MeetUp was much smaller than our TensorFlow one (see other posts for those presentations), 
since we envision something more researchy, more discussion-based for this group.  

As an example of how 'out there' we'd like to go, I decided to chat about the DeepMind
paper ["A simple neural network module for relational reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01427).  This was 
made easier because of the out-before-the-ink-was-dry implementation of the paper's main contribution (in PyTorch) 
by [kimhc6028](https://github.com/kimhc6028/relational-networks).  I added to the code
in [my own fork](https://github.com/mdda/relational-networks), partly to make sure I understood what 
was going on and also to check that the RN model actually performs better than the CNN-MLP one.

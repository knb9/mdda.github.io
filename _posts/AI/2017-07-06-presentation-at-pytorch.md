Sam Witteveen and I recently started the PyTorch and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp,
and [the first MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/PyTorch-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/240312311/) 
was hosted at Facebook, in their new Singapore offices.

By design, this MeetUp was much smaller than our TensorFlow one (see other posts for those presentations), 
since we envision something more researchy, more discussion-based for this group.

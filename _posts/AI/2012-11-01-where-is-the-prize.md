Building a conscious machine is an huge challenge.  
And it's not clear that it will be easy to declare a 'winner' amongst those in the race to do it.

(
Particularly since researchers are now creating Turing-Test candidates 
that plainly violate the spirit of the test.  Perhaps there should be an additional requirement that the 
computer 'testee' should make an earnest effort to participate :
being indistinguishable from a participant in a gaming chat-room 
doesn't seem to be an appropriate hurdle, somehow.
)

If the battle is to reach self-awareness, is self-preening in a mirror sufficient?
Or making philosophical arguments that place the machine 
at a 'highly enlightened' point on a thoughtfullness scale? 

In any event, it is not clear whether machine consciousness is a huge win in itself :  
There are, after all, a very large number of conscious beings already on earth.

More interesting would be the creation of a new type of consciousness, 
though there's no guarantee that people would even recognize it for what is is.

Placeholder while working on Kaggle HowTo

A working solution to the Billion Word Imputation challenge will appear on [my GitHub account](http://github.com/mdda) 
shortly (was planned for 15-Jan-2015, still in process).


### Presentation Link

I recently gave a <strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2015-01-15_Presentation-PyDataSG/" target="_blank">presentation about this project</a></strong> 
to the [Singapore PyData MeetUp Group](https://www.facebook.com/events/994351117258134/).

If there are any questions about the presentation, please ask below, or via the MeetUp group.

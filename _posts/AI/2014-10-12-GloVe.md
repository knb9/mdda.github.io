This write-up contains my first impressions of the paper : 
[GloVe - Global Vectors for Word Representation - (Pennington, Socher, Manning 2014)](http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf).

### Paper Background




### Surprising stuff

*  Open Source (Apache 2) code [made available](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
  
*  Briefly on front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8432072), but didn't last long, unfortunately.


### Ideas to Follow-Up

Seems like the core ```glove.c``` is ripe for rewriting as ```OpenCL```, and benchmarking...

Currently using this as the basic word-vector generator for the Kaggle 1-billion word challenge.

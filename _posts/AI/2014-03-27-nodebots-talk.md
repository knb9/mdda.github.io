Seeing a recent presentation from Google on 
["Large Scale Deep Learning" (Jeff Dean, Google)](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/people/jeff/CIKM-keynote-Nov2014.pdf), 
I realized that it may be something interesting for one of the Singapore meetup groups to hear about.

Since I had also made a small contribution to 
[the ConvnetJS project](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs) 
by Andrej Karpathy at Stanford, 
which has [a beautiful website](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/), 
I thought these two pieces could be elegantly combined...


### Presentation Link

I recently gave the resulting 
<strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2014-12-18_DeepLearning.js/" target="_blank">presentation about Deep Learning</a></strong> 
to the [Singapore Talk.js MeetUp Group](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/219129996/).

If there are any questions about the presentation, please ask below, or via the [SingaporeJS MeetUp](http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/) group.

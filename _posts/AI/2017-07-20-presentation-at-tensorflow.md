Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the sixth MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/241183195/) 
was again hosted by Google.

My 30 minute talk covered a wide range of tips, tricks and lessons learned from 
banging my head against a wall when developing Deep Learning models.

The presentation also includes links to the relevant code at suitable points.

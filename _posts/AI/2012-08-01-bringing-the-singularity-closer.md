Designing single purpose machines is relatively easier than generalized AI.


One-Dimensional Talents
------------------------------------------
IBM's Watson machine, in its Jeopardy playing mode, 
was never designed to be a "fully rounded individual".

Because Watson was designed for a particular goal, 
it is easy (in retrospect) for people to accept that it would excel at the 
'1-dimensional task' that it was built for.  After the initial euphoria of success, 
the audience readily placed it on the same spectrum of clever/smart machines on which 
computer chess Grandmasters had already been assigned a spot.

Humans are faced with a very nebulous task ahead when building a generalized AI.
In contrast, the task of building bigger, more powerful or more efficient machines 
sounds like something that could be characterised as a '1-dimensional task'.  Given the available precedents, 
it's relatively easy to accept that creating a machine that could do this specific task 
better than the best available human is a practical goal.  After all, 
humans already have to use computer assistance to build microprocessors.

Simple proposal : Create a Watson that is good at designing better Watsons.


When does the Singularity Arrive?
------------------------------------------

Humans may not be able to design AIs - but the singularity doesn't have to wait until we can.  
We can accelerate pace of development by building a better developer first.

The singularity may be closer than it first appears : It doesn't happen 
when we can surpass an average human's generalized intelligence.  The singularity occurs when 
there's a machine-designing Watson that can design its own successor (and financiers are willing to invest in its designs).

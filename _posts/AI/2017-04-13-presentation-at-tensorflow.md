Sam Witteveen and I recently started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp,
and [the third MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/238584480/) 
was again hosted by Google.

This talk included a <a href="https://github.com/mdda/deep-learning-workshop/blob/master/notebooks/2-CNN/6-StyleTransfer/4-Art-Style-Transfer-inception_tf.ipynb" target="_blank">TensorFlow version of the Art-Style-Transfer notebook</a> that was already in the 
deep-learning-workshop repo - and I have to admit, the overall example is probably better in the TF version,
because I teased out some details along the way.

There are links given in the presentation to the code and online examples.

### Refactoring

By the way, the deep-learning-workshop repo is undergoing some major refactoring.  The aim is to 
make the individual examples work in a stand-alone fashion (downloading the necessary dependencies) while
the assembled-into-a-VM still works with everything pre-loaded. 

That means that downloading an individual notebook and stepping through it should *just work*.  If it doesn't 
please let me know, and I'll prioritorize fixing it.

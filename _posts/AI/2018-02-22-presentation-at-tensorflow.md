### Presentation Link

Sam Witteveen and I started the TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore group on MeetUp in February 2017,
and [the eleventh MeetUp, aka TensorFlow and Deep Learning: NIPS](https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/247733545/),
was again hosted by Google (we're only up to 11 because we essentially skipped one month because of venue scheduling conflicts at Google HQ).

The line-up of talks included my talk on 'Practice and Trends', 
Olzhas describing Capsule Networks (with code), 
Chaitanya (a researcher from EPFL, now at SAP via NTU) presenting "Personalization in Goal-Oriented Dialog" 
which he co-wrote and was featured in the NIPS Conversational Agents Workshop, 
and Sam looking at the developments in the space of ML that creates other ML models (eg: AutoML).

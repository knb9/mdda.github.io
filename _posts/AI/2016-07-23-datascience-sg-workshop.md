### Presentation Link

I recently lead a <strong><a href="http://redcatlabs.com/2016-07-23_DataScienceSG-DeepLearning-Workshop/" target="_blank">2.5hr 'hardcore' workshop</a></strong> 
at the [DataScience SG MeetUp](http://www.meetup.com/DataScience-SG-Singapore/events/232577187/) in Singapore.

The workshop was somewhat similar in structure to my previous PyCon one - except that it had a DataScience flavour.  To 
add to that, I created a new 'application' that showed how Autoencoders could be used to do anomaly detection (with MNIST
as the base data).

In addition to that, we went through the CNN-Commerce example, so that people could see how 
a pretrained CNN could be repurposed to be used on classes that hadn't previously been encountered by the network.

### Video Link

And the excellent folks at [Engineers.sg](https://engineers.sg/) also generously made a video of the presentation
which is available <a href="https://engineers.sg/video/deep-learning-workshop-datasciencesg--913" target="_blank">on their site</a>.  Their 
videos are normally excellent, though I can't vouch for this one, since I can't bear to watch myself...

\begin{abstract}
In an interview during AGI 2014, Joscha Bach made an interesting comment that 
building AGI would be the result of (ballpark) 100 different new ideas - 
with Backpropagation being an example idea on that list.  This discussion paper 
outlines a few more candidate building blocks, while putting Backpropagation 
in context

\section{Fixed-Period Problems: The Sublinear Case}
%




With this chapter, the preliminaries are over, and we begin the search
for periodic solutions to Hamiltonian systems. All this will be done in
the convex case; that is, we shall study the boundary-value problem
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \dot{x}&=&JH' (t,x)\\
  x(0) &=& x(T)
\end{eqnarray*}
with $H(t,\cdot)$ a convex function of $x$, going to $+\infty$ when
$\left\|x\right\| \to \infty$.

%
\subsection{Autonomous Systems}
%





In this section, we will consider the case when the Hamiltonian $H(x)$
is autonomous. For the sake of simplicity, we shall also assume that it
is $C^{1}$.

We shall first consider the question of nontriviality, within the
general framework of
$\left(A_{\infty},B_{\infty}\right)$-subquadratic Hamiltonians. In
the second subsection, we shall look into the special case when $H$ is
$\left(0,b_{\infty}\right)$-subquadratic,
and we shall try to derive additional information.
%
\subsubsection{The General Case: Nontriviality.}
%
We assume that $H$ is
$\left(A_{\infty},B_{\infty}\right)$-sub\-qua\-dra\-tic at infinity,
for some constant symmetric matrices $A_{\infty}$ and $B_{\infty}$,
with $B_{\infty}-A_{\infty}$ positive definite. Set:
\begin{eqnarray}
\gamma :&=&{\rm smallest\ eigenvalue\ of}\ \ B_{\infty} - A_{\infty} \\
  \lambda : &=& {\rm largest\ negative\ eigenvalue\ of}\ \
  J \frac{d}{dt} +A_{\infty}\ .
\end{eqnarray}

Theorem~\ref{ghou:pre} tells us that if $\lambda +\gamma < 0$, the
boundary-value problem:


\paragraph{Notes and Comments.}


The first results on subharmonics were
obtained by Rabinowitz in \cite{rab}, who showed the existence of
infinitely many subharmonics both in the subquadratic and superquadratic
case, with suitable growth conditions on $H'$. Again the duality
approach enabled Clarke and Ekeland in \cite{clar:eke:2} to treat the
same problem in the convex-subquadratic case, with growth conditions on
$H$ only.

Recently, Michalek and Tarantello (see \cite{mich:tar} and \cite{tar})
have obtained lower bound on the number of subharmonics of period $kT$,
based on symmetry considerations and on pinching estimates, as in
Sect.~5.2 of this article.
